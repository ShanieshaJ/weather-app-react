## Peri Weather
This is a web application and it is made using React. This application can search the current weather forecast of the city and will give you current temperature (high/low), displaying 5 day forecast, wind speed, and humidity level. This web app is deployed on Netlify.

## Lessons Learned
From what I learned from buliding this application is that I had to learn the new features in React 18 since the previous version features had become out-updated. The first version of the application was using React 17. But experienced challenges when trying to update the code by using the correct sytaxes for React 18.
